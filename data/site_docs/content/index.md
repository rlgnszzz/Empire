## Empire

Empire is a pure PowerShell post-exploitation agent built on cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. It premiered at [BSidesLV in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9t59w0mUI).

Empire relies heavily on the work from several other projects for its underlying functionality. We have tried to call out a few of those people we've interacted with [heavily here](http://www.powershellempire.com/?page_id=2) and have included author/reference link information in the source of each Empire module as appropriate. If we have failed to improperly cite existing or prior work, please let us know.

Empire is developed by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y), [@sixdub](https://twitter.com/sixdub), [@enigma0x3](https://twitter.com/enigma0x3), [@xorrior](https://twitter.com/xorrior), [@rvrsh3ll](https://twitter.com/424f424f), and [@killswitch-GUI](https://twitter.com/killswitch_GUI).

## Documentation
Empire maintains these docs based on comunity support. The older version of this can be found at:  [http://www.powershellempire.com](http://www.powershellempire.com).

We made the move to Github Hosted pages to maintain easy documentation while allowing others now the opportunity to conduct pull requests on the documentation. The hope is as people discover, learn and use Empire they will give back when they see fit.

## Questions?
We currently have a very active slack room, come join us and others at: [http://adaptiveempire.herokuapp.com/](http://adaptiveempire.herokuapp.com/)
